### Pokè-Battles

The overall conecpt of the app is to play Pokèmon battles in your command line against the machine (*this may be improved in the future*).

It's also possible to add or modify new Pokèmons or abilities by modifying the corresponding JSON files (see *assets* folder) or by using the *add_content.py* file.

To be playable, a Pokèmon will need to have registered abilities. The Pokèmon's image is not necessary but not having it will cause the other sprite to be missprinted. You can add pokemon images by adding them to the *assets/pokemon_images* folder.
